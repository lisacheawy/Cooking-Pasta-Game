# Cooking Pasta Game

### Introduction
This is a single-player game which involves keyboard and mouse input. It takes the player through the process of creating a pasta dish where the player is required to perform a series of tasks within each stage. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) and sound effects were implemented to allow an immersive experience and realistic visualization of a cooking environment.
* This game was developed using Scala, and the GUI library used was ScalaFX.
* All illustrations were designed using Adobe Illustrator.
* All audio clips used are no-copyright and royalty-free, unless stated.
