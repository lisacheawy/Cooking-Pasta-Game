# Cooking Pasta Game
A cooking game which I have developed as my final project for Object-Oriented Programming using Scala.

### Introduction
This is a single-player game which involves keyboard and mouse input. It takes the player through the process of creating a pasta dish where the player is required to perform a series of tasks within each stage. A realistic Graphical User Interface (GUI) and sound effects were implemented to allow an immersive experience and realistic visualization of a cooking environment.
* This game was developed using Scala, and the GUI library used was ScalaFX.
* All illustrations were designed using Adobe Illustrator.
* All audio clips used are no-copyright and royalty-free, unless stated.  

### Installation Guide
ScalaFX was used in this project. As such, JDK 8 is required.

```
JDK 8
  1. Go to https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ to download JavaFx, preferably Long Term Support (LTS).
  2. After downloading the zip file, extract the files into a folder in your drive.
  3. Go to environment variables to add the path of the folder to the system variable.
```
